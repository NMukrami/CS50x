#### Video Demo: <https://youtu.be/Mlff0nQca_o>
#### Description:
Welcome to the Random Joke Generator, your one-stop destination for endless laughter and amusement! In this project, I have crafted a delightful and engaging website that offers users the joy of generating jokes randomly and even contributing their own. Allow me to take you on a detailed journey through this humorous digital playground. This project is a simple website that allows users to generate jokes randomly and also contribute their own jokes. Here's a brief overview of the project. I created this website using a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It's a lighthearted project designed to bring a smile to your face with jokes. The website uses an API from icanhazdadjoke.com to fetch jokes.
#### Features:
1. **Random Joke Generator**: Users can click a button to generate a random joke. The website makes an API request to icanhazdadjoke.com and displays a new joke each time the button is pressed.

2. **User-Submitted Jokes**: Users can also contribute their own jokes by filling out a simple form. These submitted jokes are stored and can be displayed in this website.

3. **Stylish Icons and Fonts**: The project makes use of icons from [boxicons.com](https://boxicons.com) to enhance the visual appeal. Additionally, it uses fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) to improve the typography and overall design.

## Project Duration
Building this project was a journey of learning, creativity, and pure enjoyment. It took approximately one week to transform the initial idea into a fully functioning website. During this time, I honed my web development skills and gained valuable experience working with APIs, ensuring that the final product is not only entertaining but also technically sound. This project was a labor of love and a testament to the power of web development in creating engaging and interactive online experiences.

Feel free to explore the project and enjoy some jokes!
